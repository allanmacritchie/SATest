# SATest

Initial code works in Chrome, Firefox and Safari in Windows 10
Script not returning results to the page on IE11, Edge or mobile safari, no other browsers tested.
Validation messages removed as not working in JS so fallback browser behaviour bein used for non entry of text.
Outup displayed in standard bootstrap grid - preference would have been to add Masonry JS to compress page length.
