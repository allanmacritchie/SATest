<p>Initial code works in Chrome, Firefox and Safari in Windows 10 as well as Safari on iPhone and iPad</p>
<p>Script not returning results to the page on IE11, Edge or mobile chrome on iOS, no other browsers tested.</p>
<p>Validation messages removed as not working in JS so fallback browser behaviour bein used for non entry of text.</p>
<p>Outup displayed in standard bootstrap grid - preference would have been to add Masonry JS to compress page length.</p>
